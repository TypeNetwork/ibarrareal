Spain treasures a wide typographic and calligraphic heritage.
Possibly the most important letterpress types are those cast in 1780 for the printed edition of Don Quixote for the Royal Academy of the Spanish Language by the most prestigious Spanish printer of all time, Joaqu√≠n Ibarra.
His name is used for this important digital type revival.

The original typeface design was made for the Printing of the Royal Library by Geronimo Gil, who was advised by Francisco Javier de Santiago Palomares.
The design was presented to the Academy in 1776.
It demonstrates an interesting symbiosis between calligraphic and engraved genres of typeface design.

The "Ibarra Real", project began with research conducted by Jose Maria Ribagorda at the National Chalcography of Spain, heiress of Royal Printing, between 2007 and 2009.
This project consisted of the design and reconstruction of the types of Geronimo Gil for transfer to digital media.
The project ended with the exhibition, "Imprenta Real: Fonts of Spanish Typography."
In 2015, the digital fonts were revised and improved in collaboration with the Spanish typographer Octavio Pardo.
In 2018, the sources of the Ibarra Real fonts became available as libre fonts, under the SIL Open Font License.
This means that it will not only be freely usable and widely distributed, but the source files can be a reason for study and adaptation. The production of this design was always aimed at the patrimonial and cultural recovery of one of the best examples of Spanish writing and Spanish printing. The Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando, sponsor of the project through the National Calcography, thus assures its character of public and common patrimony of all, and its distribution has been always free of charge.
