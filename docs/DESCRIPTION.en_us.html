This font is the fruit of a wider initiative dating back to 2007, when Calcografía Nacional (Spain’s national and historical engraving workshop) organised a project directed by José María Ribagorda focusing on and highlighting Spain’s typographic heritage, with the support of Spain’s Ministry for Industry.

Nowadays, nobody questions the significance and growth of the Spanish language as a tool for communication between different countries and cultures around the world, and the intangible capital as well as the economic impact involved in the use of signs that could be recognised as belonging to our cultural heritage.

This project is aimed at filling an important gap, for the myriad of texts now written in the Spanish-speaking community use font types created in other cultural milieus. This is why we believe it is important, as our language becomes more relevant, to associate this reality with the recovery of the Imprenta Real types that were developed in Spain in the eighteenth century. Thus we will be able to make them better known, making them more accessible by means of the digital media available to us now.

In 2018, the sources of the Ibarra Real fonts became available under the SIL Open Font License. This means that it will not only be freely usable and widely distributed, but the source files can be a reason for study and adaptation. The production of this design was always aimed at the patrimonial and cultural recovery of one of the best examples of Spanish writing and Spanish printing. The Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando, sponsor of the project through the National Calcography, thus assures its character of public and common patrimony of all, and its distribution has been always free of charge.
