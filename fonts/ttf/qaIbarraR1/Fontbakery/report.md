* 🔥 **FAIL** OS/2 fsType is a legacy DRM-related field.
In this font it is set to 8 meaning that:
The font may be embedded but must only be installed temporarily on other systems.

No such DRM restrictions can be enabled on the Google Fonts collection, so the fsType field must be set to zero (Installable Embedding) instead.
Fonts with this setting indicate that they may be embedded and permanently installed on the remote system by an application.

-----------------------------------------------------------



PREAMBLE

The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide

development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation

efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and

open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership

with others.



The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and

redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The

fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 

redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved

names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,

however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The

requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply

to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.



DEFINITIONS

"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright

Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may

include source files, build scripts and documentation.



"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the

copyright statement(s).



"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as

distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).



"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,

or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the

Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a

new environment.



"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical

writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007

-----------------------------------------------------------



PREAMBLE

The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide

development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation

efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and

open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership

with others.



The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and

redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The

fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 

redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved

names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,

however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The

requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply

to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.



DEFINITIONS

"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright

Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may

include source files, build scripts and documentation.



"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the

copyright statement(s).



"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as

distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).



"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,

or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the

Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a

new environment.



"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical

writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.



3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font

Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding

Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as

presented to the users.



4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font

Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any

Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007

-----------------------------------------------------------



PREAMBLE

The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide

development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation

efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and

open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership

with others.



The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and

redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The

fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 

redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved

names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,

however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The

requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply

to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.



DEFINITIONS

"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright

Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may

include source files, build scripts and documentation.



"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the

copyright statement(s).



"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as

distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).



"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,

or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the

Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a

new environment.



"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical

writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.



PERMISSION & CONDITIONS

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining

a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,

redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font

Software, subject to the following conditions:



1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,

in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.



2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,

redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy

contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be

included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or

in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or

binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.



3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font

Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding

Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as

presented to the users.



4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font

Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any

Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the

Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written

permission.



5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,

must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be

distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to

remain under this license does not apply to any document created

using the Font Software.



TERMINATION

This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are

not met.
